A web server built using the Flask micro-framework that interacts with the Canary argument mining library.

**This server, and the Canary library, is still in development and may require some work to get working on your own
machine. Use at your own risk.**

## What is Argument Mining?

Argument Mining is the process of automatically extracting and identifying arguments from natural language. This can be
essays, political debates, scientific journals, or any text that contains evidence of argumentation. Argument mining has
roots within machine learning and natural language processing and extends these to identify argumentative components and
structures.

## How do I start the server? 
From your terminal:

```bash
pipenv run flask run
```
